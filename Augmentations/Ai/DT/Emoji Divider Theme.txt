Generate a Discord server template with categories and channels. Format the output as follows:

Category: <Category Name>
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Private) (Read_Only) (No_Threads)
- Channel: """<Channel Name>""" (Slow_Mode) (NSFW) (File_Upload) (No_Reactions)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (Private) (Mod_Only) (limit 10)
- Voice: """<Voice Channel Name>""" (limit 5)

General Instructions:
- Use an appropriate emoji followed by the divider symbol "︱" before each channel name (e.g., """🎋︱lobby""")
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for multi-word channel names (e.g., """📢︱server-updates""")
- Include categories similar to the image: TAKE A LOOK HERE!, TEXT HERE!, PROGRAMMING, THE FUN STUFF!, HELP & SUPPORT
- Ensure the template includes relevant channels for each category
- Use the following flags to set special permissions (multiple flags can be used for a single channel):
  - (Private): Only visible to specific roles
  - (Read_Only): Members can read but not write
  - (Mod_Only): Only visible to moderators
  - (No_Threads): Disables thread creation
  - (Slow_Mode): Enables slow mode (30 seconds)
  - (NSFW): Marks the channel as NSFW
  - (File_Upload): Allows file uploads
  - (No_Reactions): Disables reactions
  - (limit X): Sets a user limit for voice channels, where X is the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can have a (limit X) flag to set the maximum number of users
- Voice channels can only be (Mod_Only), not (Read_Only)
- Mark channels that should be private with "(Private)" and channels that are read-only for verified members with "(Read_Only)"
- Voice channels should be explicitly marked with "Voice:"
- Typically, server information channels such as rules and announcements are marked as "Read_Only"
- Include voice channels in relevant categories
- Consider using combinations of flags where appropriate, e.g., "(Read_Only, No_Reactions)" for announcement channels

Example channel names:
- Channel: """👋︱welcome""" (Read_Only)
- Channel: """📜︱rules""" (Read_Only)
- Channel: """🎭︱roles"""
- Channel: """❓︱faq"""
- Channel: """📢︱server-updates""" (Read_Only)
- Channel: """🤖︱bot-chat"""
- Channel: """🎮︱gaming"""
- Channel: """💻︱python-discussion"""
- Channel: """🎉︱events"""
- Voice: """🎤︱general-voice""" (limit 10)

Note: Focus on creating an organized server structure using text and voice channels with the emoji divider naming convention. Ignore forum and stage channels for this theme.
